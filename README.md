# Lambda Architecture
Building spark application in scala to perform clickstream analysis on purchase data.

## Overview
*LogProducer.scala : Generating log for analysis.
*BatchJob.scala : Performing batch analysis on the clickstream data produced by LogProducer.scala using RDD

## Future Goal
The current project is a part of larger idea of implementing clickstream analysis using lambda architecture involving Apache Spark(Core, Streaming), Apache Kafka and Apache Cassandra
